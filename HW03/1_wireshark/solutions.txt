# Trace 3: Traceroute
## Briefly describe how the traceroute tool works including which network protocols are in use.
The tool will send UDP messages with increasing Time-To-Live (TTL) of IP protocol from 1 to receive the TTL exceeded ICMP packets from the hosts on the path between the source IP and destination IP, which complain the TTL is used up or exceeded. Thus, the tool will know the IP address of the devices between itself and the target host.

destination IP address: 74.125.225.46
