# Part A:

## Recovered password
13145820

## Pseudocode for attack

Target Hash := T
Target Password := K
Loop over possbile password length L
    Loop over possbile password combination P
        C(P) := Concated result of username, password and salt
        H(C(P)) := SHA-256 Hash of C(P)
        If H(C(P)) = T:
            K = P
            End

## Worst case running time

Worst-case running time will be O(10^L), where L is the max possbile password length.


## Discussion of current proposal and suggestions for improvement

The choice of the hash function is good and adding salt and username before doing the hash is also good. 
However, the password itself is not strong enough, which make attacker easy to do brute force attack. 
Thus, I suggest that user should be require to set longer and more complex password.
