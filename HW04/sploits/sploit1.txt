## General Idea of Exploitation
Use buffer overflow to overwrite the save EIP with the address of the address that corresponding to the location
of NOP before the start of shellcode in the buffer.

## Steps
- Write sample code to generate buffer and execute the target program
- Buffer structure [NOP]...[NOP][shellcode]...[shellcode][jmpAddr]...[jmpAddr]
- Use GDB to find out the right `jmpAddr` (`0xbffffce0`) which should between the start of buffer and the start of shellcode
- Set the right `jmpAddr`
- Note that input size should not change during debug so that the address will not change because of the changing of argument size
